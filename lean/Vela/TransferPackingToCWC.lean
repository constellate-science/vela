# Cross-frontier transfer: bounded-intersection packing → Constant-Weight Code (→ DNA)

The pro model's #2 transfer is `Steiner(t,k,v) → CWC(v, 2(k−t+1), k)`: map each block to its incidence
vector; since distinct Steiner blocks meet in at most `t−1` points, the incidence vectors have pairwise
Hamming distance `≥ 2(k−t+1)`. This file formalizes the tractable, load-bearing core: the
**bounded-intersection → minimum-distance** step.

For constant-weight-`k` binary words, Hamming distance and support-intersection are tied by
`Ham x y + 2·|x ∩ y| = wt(x) + wt(y)` (proved here, subtraction-free as `ham_both_wt`). Hence a family of
weight-`k` words with pairwise support-intersection `≤ s` is a constant-weight code with minimum distance
`2(k−s)`. Taking `s = t−1` recovers the Steiner bound `2(k−t+1)`.

The transfer then *composes* with `cwcToDna` (the #1 transfer) via the `Transfer.comp` category
structure, giving a single proven bridge `packing → CWC → DNA`. The Steiner→packing step itself (distinct
blocks meet in `≤ t−1` points) is exhibited operationally end-to-end in
`scripts/transfer_cwc_to_dna_demo.py` through the frozen `verify_steiner`/`verify_constantweight`/
`verify_dnacode`. Mathlib-free; no `sorry`/`axiom`.
